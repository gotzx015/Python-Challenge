# Python-Challenge
There are two separate python scripts in the Python-Challenge repo. These python scripts have two separate purposes and I will describe each of them below.

PyBank Directory:
This directory contains:

	* main.py	
	* Resources directory which contains csv file
	* Analysis directory which contains txt file

The main.py script in the PyBank directory reads in data from the budget_data.csv file and outputs this information into computer terminal and output.txt file:

	* The total number of months included in the dataset
	* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
	* The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
	* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
	* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period


PyPoll Directory:
This directory contains:

	* main.py	
	* Resources directory which contains csv file
	* Analysis directory which contains txt file

The main.py script in the PyPoll directory reads in data from the election_data.csv file and outputs this information into computer terminal and output.txt file:

	* The total number of votes cast
	* A complete list of candidates who received votes
	* The percentage of votes each candidate won
	* The total number of votes each candidate won
	* The winner of the election based on popular vote
